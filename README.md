Student Login Feature for College Website
Overview
The student login feature is a critical component of a college website, providing students with secure access to their personal information, results, and other relevant details stored in a backend database. This feature ensures that only authenticated students can view and interact with their data, which is securely managed and retrieved from a MongoDB database.

Key Components
Login Page:

Username and Password Fields: Students enter their credentials (username/email and password).
Login Button: Triggers the authentication process.

Backend Server:

Node.js/Express: Handles HTTP requests and serves as the backend framework.
Authentication Middleware: Validates user credentials and manages sessions or JWT tokens.
MongoDB: Stores student information and credentials.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a schema-based solution to model data.
Database (MongoDB):

Collections:
students: Stores student details (name, email, course, grades, etc.).
users: Stores authentication data (username, hashed password, role).

Workflow
Student Login Process:

The student navigates to the login page.
They enter their username/email and password and click the login button.
The frontend (React/HTML form) sends a POST request to the backend server with the entered credentials.
Authentication:

The backend server receives the login request.
The server uses Mongoose to query the users collection in MongoDB to find the matching username/email.
If the user is found, the server verifies the password using bcrypt or a similar hashing algorithm.
If the credentials are correct, the server generates a session or JWT token for the student.
The server responds with the token, which the frontend stores (usually in localStorage or cookies).
Accessing Student Details:

Once logged in, the student can navigate to their dashboard.
fetches the student’s details from the students collection in MongoDB.
The backend sends the student’s details to the frontend.
The frontend displays the information to the student.
